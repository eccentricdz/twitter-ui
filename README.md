# twitter-ui
Trying to imitate the twitter UI as part of a challenge. Have designed the UI using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
* Have used flex-box for layout
* Sass for CSS
* The tweets are generated dynamically via a JSON, using RequireJS and jQuery
* The page is reponsive
* Have used CSS keyframes and transitions for animation.
